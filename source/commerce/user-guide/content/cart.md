# Cart

The Cart page is a required page that allows users to manage the contents of their cart. There are three associated widgets: _Cart_, _Cart Summary_, _Mini Cart_.

**Cart** displays the contents of the cart. The widget contains the _Update_ button to change the quantity and _Delete_ to remove the item from the cart.

**Cart Summary** displays the cart's subtotal, any applicable taxes, the total amount, and the _Checkout_ button.

**Mini Cart** displays the cartâ€™s contents and an _Edit Cart_ button that links to the Commerce _Cart_ widget. The _Mini Cart_ widget has to be deployed on the same page with the _Cart_ widget.
