# Setting Inventory by Warehouse

This article documents how to set inventory by warehouse. Some stores may have more than one warehouse and store managers can set product quantity per location. The _Inventory_ menu is where store administrators manage the number of products available for sale in each warehouse. If the [Minium Accelerator](../getting-started/using-the-minium-accelerator-to-jump-start-your-b2b-store.md) was used to create the store, there are three warehouses already created.

To set inventory by warehouse:

1. Navigate to the _Control Panel_ → _Commerce_ → _Products_.
1. Click on a product (for example _U-Joint_).
1. Click the _SKUs_ sub-tab.
1. Click on the SKU ID (_MIN-55861_).
1. Click _Inventory_ on the left menu.
1. Enter a quantity for the corresponding warehouse(s).

1. Click _Save_ for each warehouse.
1. Repeat these steps for all the other product variants (SKUs) associated for a product.

Each warehouse now has the correct quantity available for sale.
