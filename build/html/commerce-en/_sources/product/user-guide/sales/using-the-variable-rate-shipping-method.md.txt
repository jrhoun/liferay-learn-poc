# Using the Variable Rate Shipping Method

Variable rate shipping allows shipping costs to be calculated using three factors: weight, order subtotal (cost before shipping, taxes, and discounts), and a configurable flat rate. The store administrator may configure the weighting of each factor in the shipping calculation.

Multiple different shipping options with variable rates may be created. For example, a 'Standard Ground' option with a low cost per weight can be created. In contrast, a “Two-Day Air” option can be created that uses the same logic as 'Standard Ground', but has a higher cost per weight.

## Creating a Variable Rate Shipping Option

Variable-rate shipping costs are determined by the following formula:

`shipping costs = [fixed price] + ([order total weight] * [rate unit weight price]) * ([order subtotal] x [rate percentage])`

To create a new Variable Rate shipping option:

1. Navigate to _Site Administration_ → _Commerce_ → _Settings_.
1. Click the _Shipping Methods_ tab.
1. Click _Variable Rate_.
1. Click the _Shipping Options_ tab.
1. Click the (+) button to add a new Shipping option:
1. Enter the following:
    * **Name**: 2 Day Ground
    * **Description**: 2 Day Ground
    * **Priority**: 3.0
